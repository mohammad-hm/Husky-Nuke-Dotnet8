- The first command, `dotnet new tool-manifest`, creates a manifest file in your project directory that lists the tools that you want to install locally. The manifest file is named `dotnet-tools.json` and it is stored in a `.config` folder. You can use this file to share the tools with other developers who work on the same project.

- The second command, `dotnet tool install Husky`, installs the Husky tool from the NuGet package and adds it to the manifest file.

   ```bash
   dotnet husky install
   ```
